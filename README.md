# College Appointment API

A RESTful backend API to manage appointment scheduling and handling for college systems (e.g. student-faculty appointments, counseling slots, etc.).

## 🚀 Features

- Create, update, delete, and list appointment slots  
- Book or cancel appointments  
- Role-based access control (students, faculty, admin)  
- Validation and error handling  
- Modular architecture (routes, controllers, services)  
- Unit & integration test coverage  

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** with **Express**  
- **MongoDB** (or other NoSQL/relational DB, configurable)  
- **JWT** authentication & authorization  
- **Joi** (or any schema validator) for request validation  
- **Mocha/Chai** or **Jest** for testing

- Middleware for **role-based authorization**  
  - **Admin/Faculty** → Create and manage appointment slots  
  - **Students** → Book or cancel appointments  

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests for controllers and services  
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- Use a separate test database or mocks for safe testing
